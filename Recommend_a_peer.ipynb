    "# This Project serves as the last portfolio project as part of the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/data-scientist-ml) data science: machine learning specialist career path and aims to independently analzye the data from a source called \"OKCupid\"\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "### \"The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions. However, the questions you ask and how you answer them are entirely up to you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More about the idea:\n",
    "   > `from the direct Codecademy source` : In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance. In this portfolio project, you will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Althought the dataset revolves around the concept of dating I want to re-direct the vector of attention to aspects that fit me as a person and my beliefs thus shifting it into \"Recommend a Peer\". The usual steps including Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning Model Selection, Evaluation, and Tuning, will be followed. The `Scope` ultimately is to showcase what I learnt throughtout the careerpath. I also plan to refactor the code to accomodate the concept of pipelines and explore deploying it for a more practical feel further down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific this project, utilizes three machine learning models in order to achieve different goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Predicting a feature about a user based on data available\n",
    "    > Grouping users in order to recognize patterns\n",
    "    > A recommender model that recommendes a peer"
