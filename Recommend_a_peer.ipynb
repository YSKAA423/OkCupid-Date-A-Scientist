    "# This Project serves as the last portfolio project as part of the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/data-scientist-ml) data science: machine learning specialist career path and aims to independently analzye the data from a source called \"OKCupid\"\n",

    "## More about the idea:\n",
    "   > `from the direct Codecademy source` : In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that weâ€™ve never had before about how different people experience romance. In this portfolio project, you will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.\n",

    "\n",
    "    > Re-direct the vector of attention to aspects that fit me as a person and my beliefs and allow me to withdraw all my energy on those topics.\n",
    "    > Follow the same linear steps (Introduction, Pre-Processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Machine Learning Models Selection, Evaluation, and Tuning) at first then refactor later on to fit the idea of pipelines for more automation, and hopefully the idea of deployability for practicality. (Later parts extend to paths outside of the paths but provides an a clearer picture to a practical project)\n",
