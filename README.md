# Peer Recommender System

This project focuses on creating a recommender system that suggests peers with similar attributes from a dataset. By leveraging techniques such as feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction, and clustering, the system provides meaningful and personalized recommendations based on user profiles.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of the project was to develop a robust recommender system by analyzing and processing user profile data. The system compares users' features and groups them based on shared characteristics, ultimately suggesting peers who share similar traits. The project highlights the importance of pre-processing and data transformation as foundational steps in building effective machine learning pipelines.

## Key Components

### Pre-processing and Data Preparation

Pre-processing involved handling missing values and encoding categorical data. Missing values were imputed or replaced based on their type:

*   **Categorical variables:** Missing values were replaced with "Not Shared" to prevent bias.
*   **Numerical variables:** Missing values were handled via removal, after inspecting their frequency.
*   Understanding outliers and unique values helped refine feature engineering strategies.   

Feature scaling was applied to ensure consistent magnitude across numerical features. Special cases, such as -1 values in the income field (indicating "Not Shared"), were carefully preserved to respect the "Not Missing At Random" (NMAR) nature of the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provided insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships.

* **Uni-variate and Bi-variate analysis:** Understanding individual features and pairs of features
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Applying hypothesis tests as frameworks to test associations  

### Feature Engineering

Feature transformations, such as encoding categorical data and binning numerical data into ranges, were used to make the dataset more machine-learning-friendly. Language preference columns (e.g., English, Arabic) were one-hot encoded, simplifying their integration into clustering and similarity measures.

### Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the variance. This step helped mitigate the curse of dimensionality, ensuring that clustering and similarity calculations remained computationally efficient.

### Clustering with KMeans

KMeans clustering grouped users into clusters based on shared features. By assigning users to distinct clusters, the system improved recommendation relevance by narrowing the pool of potential peers for comparison. Clustering ensured that users received recommendations from peers with similar underlying traits and preferences.

### Recommender System

The recommender system uses cosine similarity to calculate the closeness between users based on their features. Users are recommended peers from their respective clusters, ensuring contextually relevant suggestions. The system filters results to maintain logical and social alignment, but can be adjusted to recommend out of the box users.

## Significance of the Approach

### Pre-processing, EDA, and Feature Engineering

These steps are vital for cleaning, structuring, and optimizing data for downstream tasks. Handling missing values effectively prevents bias, while encoding and scaling ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

### Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

PCA and KMeans make the data manageable, enabling the system to focus on meaningful patterns. Clustering reduces noise and improves the quality of recommendations by grouping similar users together.

### Personalized Recommendations

The systemâ€™s use of cosine similarity ensures that recommendations are based on quantifiable similarity metrics, leading to personalized and relevant suggestions.

## Conclusion and Future Expansion

This project demonstrates how pre-processing, EDA, and advanced techniques like PCA and KMeans clustering can contribute to building an effective recommender system. While the current implementation focuses on peer recommendations, future expansions could include:

*   Integration of NLP for textual user descriptions to enhance the feature set.
*   Deployment as a Web Application using frameworks like FastAPI or Flask.
*   Improved Scalability using advanced algorithms and real-time data integration.

By refining and extending the system, it could evolve into a versatile recommendation platform suitable for various applications.
